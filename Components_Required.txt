	Required Components:

•	ARDUINO UNO: 						Our microcontroller to perform the logical operation.
•	H-Bridge (L293D):  					To control the motion of the two DC motor.
•	Chassis:  							It acts as a base for our whole BOT.
•	Castor wheel: 						To provide smooth movement of the robot left and right.
•	DC motor with wheels: 				To provide motion to the robot
•	Jumper wires: 						To make the circuit connections.
•	9V DC batteries: 					Supply power to th1e motor for their functioning.
•	Serial Cable: 						To transfer command generated by MATLAB to ARDUINO.
•	Smartphone(with Camera)				To record video in realtime
•	IP WebCam							Don't worry it's just an Android Application
•	Laptop(Any)							To run the MATLAB code
